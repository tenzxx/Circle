Imagine you are writing a program to calculate the circumference and area of a circular garden, given its radius. You want to represent the garden as a structure, and you want the program to display the results rounded off to 2 decimal places.

By entering the radius of the garden, the program will calculate and output the circumference and area of the circular garden, providing you with valuable information for gardening purposes.

Structure Name: struct Circle

Formula:
circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
area = PI * radius * radius

Assume that the PI value is 3.14.


Input Format
The input consists of a single floating-point number representing the radius of the circle.
Output Format
The first line of output displays the circumference of the circle rounding off to two decimal places.
The second line of output displays the area of the circle rounding off to two decimal places.
Constraints
Use PI value as 3.14.
The radius of the circle is a positive floating-point number.
